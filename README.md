## About

Welcome to my website where I plan to store various articles for various different topics. I'll most likely be writing things that interest me at a given time, so feel free to check back periodically to see if I have anything new posted.

You can find the code to the website in this repo.

The website was built using Jekyll and Chirpy Theme. For more information check out the repository for [Chirpy][chirpy]

More information exists in the ```READMEChirpy.md``` located in this repository
